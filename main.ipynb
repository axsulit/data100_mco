    "This project uses the [House Sales in King County](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/harlfoxem/housesalesprediction/data) dataset from Kaggle that contains house sale transactions for King County, including Seattle, WA, and the USA. It includes homes sold between May 2014 and May 2015. Each data instance contains details about each propertyâ€™s physical attributes, location, and transaction history, all of which are essential to find out what factors influence house sales. As recommended, the dataset can be viewed as a regression task.\n",
