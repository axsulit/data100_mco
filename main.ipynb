It includes homes sold between May 2014 and May 2015.

As recommended, the dataset can be viewed as a regression task.\n",

Urban areas, while having fewer affordable options, show significant representation in the **Luxury** category, aligning with their premium pricing. Rural areas predominantly feature affordable housing, with very few luxury properties, highlighting their position as the most budget-friendly option.\n",
    "\n",
    "These findings demonstrate the **strong correlation between location type and housing affordability**. Urban areas are synonymous with luxury, suburban regions balance affordability and mid-tier housing, and rural zones cater to budget-conscious buyers. Together, this analysis illustrates how geographic factors influence market segmentation and pricing, reinforcing the role of location in determining housing affordability."
