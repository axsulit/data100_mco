## Goals of the Analysis  
The primary goals of this analysis are:  
1. **Variable Relationships**: Explore how different factors such as size, location, amenities, and renovation history correlate with housing prices.  
2. **Socio-Economic Insights**: Examine how housing attributes reflect disparities across socio-economic groups and highlight pressing issues in housing affordability and urban planning.  
3. **Answer Research Questions**: Investigate key questions about the dataset to draw insights into the social and environmental implications of housing in King County.  

### Research Questions  
- **Aesthetic vs. Size**: Is there a relationship between housing aesthetics (e.g., waterfront, view, location) and property size (e.g., floors, room size, lot size)? What is the ratio of aesthetic to non-aesthetic houses?  
- **Condition Over Time**: Do older houses have lower quality (e.g., condition, grade), and are they more likely to undergo renovations?  
- **Urban Density**: What is the average number of houses per zip code, and does this reflect overly dense urban planning?  
- **Price Correlations**: Which variables have the strongest correlations with housing prices?  

## Broader Implications  
The analysis seeks to shed light on critical **social issues**:  
- **Housing Inequality**: Highlight disparities in housing accessibility and affordability across socio-economic groups.  
- **Urban Planning**: Explore whether housing in specific areas requires better community planning or disaster-risk management.  
- **Environmental Concerns**: Assess the implications of aesthetic features like waterfronts on the environment.  
- **Affordability**: Understand what makes housing less accessible to lower-income communities.
